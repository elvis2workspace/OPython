There are three Eclipse Launch Configurations checked in to the root directory of
the GIT-project:

- maven assemble.launch : For building an executable JAR for testing and delivery
- maven eclipse.launch  : For generating the Eclipse settings
- maven install.launch  : For building the project

All of these configurations make use of the variable 

${mvn_home}

which must be added in Eclipse. It has to point to the local Maven installation that
contains the "bin"-folder.

Otherwise all settings should work as only workspace-references are used.
